## Intro Of The Project

The purpose of this project consists in measuring the distance between the sensor and obstacles placed in the surrounding environment by means of an ultrasound sensor. 

Optionally, you can generate a sound whose frequency depends on the measured distance. The frequency should change in real-time in order to track distance variations. You can use the Matlab function sound(y,Fs) to send an audio signal y to the speaker at sample rate Fs. Another function that can be employ at the purpose is: 

player = audioplayer(y, Fs);
play(player);
